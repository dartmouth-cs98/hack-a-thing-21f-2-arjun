## Who Did What?

## What you learned

bleep bloop blorp

coding is hard

I learned how to compile C to WASM and display it as a webpage. I also learned how to compile a C library into WASM and display it as a webpage. I also learned how to use an API in python. I started learning how to compile python into C, so that I could go from python -> c -> to WASM, but I didn't have the time (sad emoji)
